# BD Todo

Single page application that talks to a small rest-api that can be used to execute simple CRUD operations on a list of
“todo”-items (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). It uses NgRx and Angular Material. There are three layers: "api", "state" and
"ui", that can be extracted in separate libs or apps with minimum refactoring. Minimal responsive design is implemented.
